 Abstract -.The present Covid-19 situation pandemic forces
studentsto attend their classesthrough online. This becomes a
difficult task for Students to listen classes as they are facing
several distractions .It also leads to Lack of communication
between Students and teachers. Even students can’ttake notes
properly. Also there will be a library in college which helpsthe
students to prepare for their Exams. This Project helps
Teachersto upload their subject related notes, videos orBooks
in the App. This project can help the students in a better way
than other apps So Students will feel so easy to study for their
exam and also helpsto gain Knowledge regarding the Subject.
It reducesthe teacher’s work as well. Also the app providesthe
students with live chat and chat assistant feature.
Key Words: Study material android application, Node JS

3. IMPLEMENTATION
NodeJS API Generation
In this project we develop the API (Application Programming
Interface) using the JavaScript framework NodeJS. Node.js
may be a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's
JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine). Node.js is an open source,
cross-platform runtime environment for developing serverside and networking applications. Node.js applications are
written in JavaScript, and may be run within the Node.js
runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. Node.js also
provides an upscale library of varied JavaScriptmodules which
simplifies the event of web applications using Node.js to an
excellent extent. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform,
back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8
engine and executes JavaScript code outside an internet
browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write down
instruction tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts
server-side to supply dynamic website content before the page
is shipped to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js
represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying webapplication development around one programming language ,
Description: Thisliterature overview is designed as a resource
for both students and instructors to gain insight into what
education research reveals about note-taking. Specifically,this





review discussesthe cognitivemechanisms behind note-taking;
he has briefly summarized some suggestions below for
students and instructors to consider regarding note-taking
